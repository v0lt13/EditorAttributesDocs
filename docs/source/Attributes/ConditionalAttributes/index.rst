Conditional Attributes
======================

**Conditional Attributes** are attributes that execute based on certain conditions.

The conditional attributes support fields, properties and functions as conditions and they can be ``private``, ``static``, ``readonly`` or ``const``.
When the attribute tries to find the condition it will first look inside the script class thats in the inspector, if it does not find it it will look into that class's parents recursively, then finnaly
it will check if the attribute is used inside a serialized class or struct and look into that.
